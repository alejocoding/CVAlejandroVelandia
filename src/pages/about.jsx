                <p>
                I am Alejandro Velandia Machado, currently studying Software Analysis and Development at SENA.
                 I have strong skills in web development, database management, user interface design,
                  and software project planning. I am also proficient in using digital tools to support 
                  productivity and organization. Beyond technical abilities, I value continuous learning,
                   adaptability, teamwork, and effective communication. I am committed to personal and 
                   professional growth, 
                and I strive to contribute positively in collaborative and goal-oriented environments.
